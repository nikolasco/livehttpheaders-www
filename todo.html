<li><b>Detect when server send the same headers multiples times</b><br>
  Some headers like Set-Cookie can be sent more than one time.  Detect this and display them
  correctly.
</li>
<li><b>Find a fast way to get POST Data when file upload are used</b><br>
  There is currently a bug (See bug #188328) that cause problem when there is a file upload in
  the post data.  If you want to see post data with file upload, you need to select 'slow' in
  the LiveHTTPHeaders window.
</li>
<li><b>Add epuration if needed</b><br>
  The headers information is kept as long as the windows is open.
</li>
<li><b>Try to detect same url in two tabs</b><br>
  If the same URL is loaded in two TABS in the same window, the information
  about the second URL will update the information about the first one
</li>
<li><b>Try to detect the version of HTTP used for response (HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/1.1)</b><br>
  LiveHTTPHeaders show HTTP/1.x for HTTP version.  Try to find a way to get the version
  used by the remote server in the response and show it instead of 1.x.
</li>
<li><b>Add a way to scroll headers left to right</b><br>
  Some headers are very long.  Find a way to display them on screen.
