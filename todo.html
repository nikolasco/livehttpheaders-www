<li><b>Find a way to install LiveHTTPHeaders on a user basis.</b><br>
  Because LiveHTTPHeaders use a components (mozilla/components), it can't be installed in 
  a user chrome directory like Linky can.  Try to find a way to do it.
</li>
<li><b>Add a way to be able to put style to the LiveHTTPWindow.</b><br>
  Add a way to be able to put style on request headers, response headers, post data, etc on 
  the LiveHTTPWindow.
</li>
<li><b>Add a way to display a tree of request.</b><br>
  This should be interesting to put a tree of the request and each sub-request (image, 
  frames, etc).  This should help in seeing all related request and the corresponding
  headers.
</li>
<li><b>Try to keep track of the time needed for each request.</b><br>
  This may help in the desing of web application.  Try to display the time needed by each
  request and groups of request and if possible, the size of them.
</li>
<li><b>Try to detect the version of HTTP used for response (HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/1.1)</b><br>
  LiveHTTPHeaders show HTTP/1.x for HTTP version.  Try to find a way to get the version
  used by the remote server in the response and show it instead of 1.x.  This is sometime 
  available in the cache but not always.  Try to get it there.
</li>
<li><b>Add tabs to the LiveHTTPHeader window for replaying URL instead of new window.</b><br>
  As the replay window needs the LiveHTTPHeader window, put the replay in new tabs instead
  of new window.  This should cleanup the desing and the look.
</li>
<li><b>Cleanup of code for the LiveHTTPWindow.</b><br>
  This code is still proof of concept.  Clean it up and add comments.
</li>
</ul>
